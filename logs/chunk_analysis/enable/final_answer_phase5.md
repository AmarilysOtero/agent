## Answer

VectorCypher Retriever is a tool designed for complex, context-aware querying within a knowledge graph, integrating both semantic and structural search capabilities. It enables users to conduct specific inquiries, such as identifying asset managers impacted by reseller concerns, by navigating relationships like OWNS to connect relevant entities. The retriever employs vector indexes for semantic retrieval and executes Cypher queries to effectively extract and analyze data, thereby providing tailored insights across structured and unstructured data sources [source: merged context, chunks: NA].

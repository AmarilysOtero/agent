## Answer

VectorCypher Retrieval is a method that enables users to pose complex, context-aware questions specific to their industry by utilizing semantic and structural search capabilities. It works by identifying semantically similar data chunks and leveraging graph relationships to extract relevant entities, such as Asset Managers impacted by certain issues. This process involves defining node types and relationships, indexing the data, and crafting domain-specific Cypher queries to retrieve information from a Neo4j knowledge graph, thus enhancing insights from both structured and unstructured data [source: merged_context, chunks: 1].

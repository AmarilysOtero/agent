# Phase 4: LLM-Generated Inspection Logic (RLM Enabled)

**Execution Time:** 2026-02-09T21:53:41.394130

**Query:** tell me about Alexis Torres

**Query Hash:** `4b459d00` (use to verify artifacts match current query)

**Total Inspection Programs:** 16

**Implementation:** MIT Recursive Inspection Model (RLM) - Per-Chunk Code Generation

**Mode:** per_chunk

---

## Overview

This file stores the **executable Python code** generated by the LLM per MIT RLM.
Each chunk gets its own Python function that determines if that specific chunk contains information relevant to the user's query.

### Purpose

- Generate chunk-specific relevance evaluation code
- Each chunk receives tailored inspection logic
- More precise relevance filtering per MIT RLM approach

### Usage

These functions (evaluate_chunk_relevance(chunk_text: str) -> bool) are executed by the recursive summarizer.

# Phase 4: LLM-Generated Inspection Logic (RLM Enabled)

**Execution Time:** 2026-02-13T14:52:34.715726

**Query:** What  is the               VectorCypherRetriever

**Query Hash:** `f8ed05ca` (use to verify artifacts match current query)

**Total Inspection Programs:** 8

**Implementation:** MIT Recursive Inspection Model (RLM) - Per-Chunk Code Generation

**Mode:** per_chunk

---

## Overview

This file stores the **executable Python code** generated by the LLM per MIT RLM.
Each chunk gets its own Python function that determines if that specific chunk contains information relevant to the user's query.

### Purpose

- Generate chunk-specific relevance evaluation code
- Each chunk receives tailored inspection logic
- More precise relevance filtering per MIT RLM approach

### Usage

These functions (evaluate_chunk_relevance(chunk_text: str) -> bool) are executed by the recursive summarizer.

The Graph-Enhanced Vector Search Pattern
The basic retriever pattern typically relies on textbased embeddings, capturing only the semantic meaning of content. While this method is effective in identifying similar chunks, it leaves the LLM in the dark as to how those items interact in the real world.

### Summary

VectorCypher Retriever is a tool that enables complex, context-aware queries by combining semantic and structural search capabilities within a knowledge graph. It allows users to ask specific questions, such as identifying asset managers affected by reseller concerns, by traversing relationships in the graph, like OWNS, to connect relevant entities. The retriever utilizes vector indexes for semantic retrieval and executes Cypher queries to extract and analyze data effectively, providing insights tailored to the user's domain. This integration enhances understanding by surfacing information across both structured and unstructured data.
